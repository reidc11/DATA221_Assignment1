# Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop
# Write a Python program that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product first
# becomes greater than a given threshold value.
# Your program should:
# • Store the threshold value in a variable.
# • Keep track of the current multiplier.
# • Print the final product and the integer that caused the product to exceed the threshold
