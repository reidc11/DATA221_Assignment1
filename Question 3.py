# Question 3: Safe Function Application
# Define a function that computes xy. Then, given a list of pairs (x, y):
# • Use a for loop with argument unpacking to call the function.
# • Skip any pair where the exponent y is negative.
# • Store the valid results in a list and print the list.


# is this one or two functions?
def pairs():
    xSquaredByY=x**y
