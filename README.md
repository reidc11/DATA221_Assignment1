Question 1.py  
Multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold. Prints the final product 
and the integer that caused the product to exceed the threshold.

Question 2.py  
Defines a function that receives a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary containing the length of each string 
and whether the length is even or odd.

Question 3.py  
Defines a function that computes x^y and applies it to a list of (x, y) pairs using argument unpacking, skipping pairs 
where the exponent is negative.

Question 4.py  
Generates a list of random values, sorts the list, and finds the indices where values are greater than or equal to a 
randomly generated value x. Prints the sorted list, x, and the first matching index if one exists.

Question 5.py  
Validates two positive integer radii, computes the area of each circle, and returns the percentage of the larger 
circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle. Returns an error message for invalid input.

Question 6.py  
Performs a distribution analysis on a list of numbers, returning a dictionary that maps each unique value to the 
percentage of list elements less than or equal to that value.

Question 7.py  
Converts a number of seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format, returning a formatted time 
string or an error message for invalid input.
